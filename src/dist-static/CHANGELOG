c3p0-0.9.1-pre6
	-- Wrote a stub of a status-monitoring servlet. Not yet documented, or
	   even usefully functional, but hopefully will be soon.
	-- Updated documentation to include new config file format, including
	   named and per-user config. Docs could still use some work, but the
	   functionality is now described.
	-- For consistency, the parameters user and password our now configurable
	   via config files and System properties.
	-- Modified DefaultC3P0ConfigFinder to properly give greater precedance to
	   System properties than to XML-defined unspecified user, default config
	   values.
	-- Added WARNING logging of create SQL and original database Exception when
	   creation of an automaticTestTable fails. [Thanks to Alexander Grivnin.]
	-- Added logic so that the Exception assoicated with the last failed acquisition
	   attempt in a round of attempts is logged along with the failure if the 
	   acquisition attempts. [Thanks to Barthel Steckemetz and Patrick Eger for
	   calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Fixed a problem whereby modifying the config of a ComboPooledDataSource
	   programmatically, while in use, causes previously checked-out Connections
	   to be close()ed underneath the user. Changing configs midstream still 
	   causes a complete resetting of the pool (because the pool holds most
	   config params as immutable to avoid having to synchronized for every
	   config param read), but old Connections from superceded pools will remain
	   valid until they are rechecked into the pool. [Thanks to hhu for noticing
	   this problem!]
        -- Fixed a resource leak whereby Connections which could not be reset after
	   client-initiated close() were properly "excluded" from future inclusion
	   in the pool, but never checked back into the pool to be destroyed. (Excluded
           resources are simply marked for destruction rather than reassimilation on
           checkin.) [Many thanks to Levi Purvis for tracking this down!]
c3p0-0.9.1-pre5a
	-- "test-classpath" was erroneously specified in build.xml to include some
	   extra jar files, which rendered undetectable (to my tests) the fact
	   that com.mchange.v1.lang.BooleanUtils was not jarred up into 
	   c3p0-0.9.1-pre5.jar as it needed to be. Very, very embarrrassing. [Thanks
	   to Goksel Uyulmaz for calling attention to this gaffe.]
c3p0-0.9.1-pre5
	-- reorganized synchronization of getConnection() in DriverManagerDataSource, 
	   so that a lock-up in one Connection acquisition attempt does not prevent 
	   other threads from accessing the DataSource. [Thanks to Fabian Gonzalez
	   for calling attention to this occasional deadlock.]
c3p0-0.9.1-pre4
	-- added overrideDefaultUser and overrideDefaultPassword parameters, and
	   a pooledDataSource( ) factory method which specifies override 
	   authentification info, regardless of the user and password properties
	   set on the DataSource.
	-- Reimplemented resource acquisition in BasicResourcePool so that each
	   Connection acquisition is a separate asynchronous task, to avoid tying
	   up the pool with very long, multiple acquisition tasks. Ended up being
	   a total rewrite of pool size management. Pools should be much more
	   conservative in acquiring new Connections. They won't grow to maxPoolSize
	   as easily as before. This is a big change. We'll see how it holds up as 
	   people beat the crap out of it.
c3p0-0.9.1-pre3
	-- Added some extra logging of resource destruction, to help debug cases
	   where the resources are removed from the pool, but appear not to have
	   been properly cleaned up.
	-- Finished implementation of new C3P0Config, added constructor methods to 
	   various DataSource implementations that accept a configName parameter for 
	   named configurations, and modified the DataSources class to use the new
	   configuration approach instead of PoolConfig wherever possible.
c3p0-0.9.1-pre2
	-- Continued implementation of new C3P0Config, including XML parsing
	   and setting of default values. Still have to test XML config, and
	   implement named and per-user configs.
	-- Changed policy of BasicResourcePool to keep accidentally overacquired
	   resources so long as the pool is kept below maxPoolSize, rather than
	   immediately discarding Connections beyond the number we intended to
	   acquire.
	-- Fixed two issues whereby checking in resources to closed pools (both
	   Connection and Statement pools) provoked Exceptions. Check-ins should
	   succeed, even to close()ed pools, with resources silently destroyed if
	   the pools ae closed. [Thanks to Chris Kessel for finding both of these
	   issues.]
	-- Modified to a one-statement-cache-per-pool model, rather than a 
	   global-statement-cache-for-all-pools, consistent with the general
	   philosophy that config parameters are on a per-auth-pool basis. 
        -- Fixed a deadlock which could occur if a pool is closed at the same time as
           one of its Connections is closed. One thread gets the pool's lock, then tries
           to get a PooledConnections lock to close it. An ordinary client closes a
           Connection, which acquires the PooledConnection's lock, and then tries to
           check back in to the pool, requiring the pool's lock. Broke the deadlock by
           making the destruction of resources on pool close asynchronous, by a Thread
	   without the resource pool's lock.. [Many thanks to Roger Westerlund for 
	   sending a full thread-stack dump capturing this deadlock!]
	-- Completed transformation to one C3P0PooledConnectionPoolManager per
	   PoolBackedDataSource model.
c3p0-0.9.1-pre1
	[This is a half-assed internal release... it compiles and works, but mostly
	it's just a checkpoint as c3p0 undergoes significant transformations.]
	-- Deprecated PoolConfig, and began implementation of new C3P0Config approach
	   to configuration.
	-- Partial transformation of C3P0PooledConnectionPoolManager from shared-manager
	   for several DataSources model to simple one-pool-per-DataSource model enabled
	   by canonicalization of DataSources.
c3p0-0.9.0.4
	-- In a subtle but major modification of BasicResourcePool, changed checkin/checkout
	   behavior from FIFO to LIFO to increase the likelihood that unnecessary Connections
	   pooled at peak times idle long enough to expire. [Many thanks to Vlad Ilyushchenko
	   and hontvari on sourceforge for noticing this important issue and suggesting the 
	   fix.]
c3p0-0.9.0.3
	-- Added code to mbean C3P0PooledDataSource to automatically create JNDI
	   subcontexts if a JNDI name is specified for which the full path has not
           been created (analogous to mkdir -p in UNIX). [Thanks to David D. Kilzer
	   for noticing the issue, and for submitting the fix!]
	-- Added logic to GooGooStatementCache to ensure that multiple threads do not
	   try to close the same PreparedStatement, in order to try to resolve longstanding
	   PreparedStatement.close() freeze issues. [Thanks to cardgames on sourceforge for
	   noticing that the freezes seem to occur when several threads are trying to close()
	   just one statement!]
	-- Added some checks in DriverManagerDataSource (as well as WrapperConnectionPoolDataSource)
	   so that a mismatch between JDBC URL and driver does not lead to null Connection
	   references and downstrem NullPointerExceptions. [Thanks to Richard Maher for
	   calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Undid some unnecessary synchronization in WrapperConnectionPoolDataSource,
	   which would cause deadlocks when the acquisition of a Connection from the 
	   underlying driver froze for some Thread. (Other threads would then block
	   trying to access the WrapperConnectionPoolDataSource.) [Thanks to Fabian 
	   Gonzales for calling attention to this issue, and for providing a VM thread
	   stack dump to help chase it down!]
	-- modified BasicMultiPropertiesConfig to never attempt to read the resource "/",
	   representing (in this case) System properties, as a stream, which under some
	   classloaders caused ClassCastExceptions. [Thanks to Joost Schouten for calling
	   attention to this issue.]
	-- fixed initial check of the readOnly and typeMap properties of Connections,
	   so that users don't see disconcerting Exceptions at debug log levels if their drivers don't
	   support these parameters.
	-- Added jar attributes Extension-Name, Specification-Vendor, Specification-Version,
	   Implementation-Vendor-Id, Implementation-Vendor, and Implementation-Version
           [per request of Pascal Grange].
	-- Added some extra debugging information for peculiar situation where an IdentityTokenized
	   is constructed and registered with C3P0Registry, but coalesces to a different Object. 
	   This should never happen, as freshly constructed IdentityTokenizeds should have String
	   versions of their identity hashcodes as tokens, and upon their registration, no copies 
	   should yet have been created and registered. [Thanks to Jose Rodriguez for noting this 
	   issue.]
c3p0-0.9.0.2
	-- added debug-level logging of connection tests and results
	-- tightened up means by which the readOnly and typeMap properties of Connections are reset,
	   so that users don't see disconcerting Exceptions at debug log levels if their drivers don't
	   support these parameters.
	-- fixed problem in BasicResourcePool that left the immediately-close-checked-out-connections option
	   in the close() method ineffective, meaning Connections checked-out from a pool would
 	   leak unless clients remembered to check them into pool for destruction.
        -- fixed bug wherein connection-testing on checking occured in a thread holding the pool's
	   lock, leading to pool hangs or deadlocks if a connection hangs. [Thanks to Tobias Jenkner
	   for calling attention to this problem!]
c3p0-0.9.0.1
        -- modify BasicPropertiesConfig to not throw class cast Exceptions in the rare case that
	   a Properties object (presumably System properties rather than a file derived props Object)
	   contains (via the Map/Hastable API) non-String keys or values. [Thanks to Prima Upot for
	   calling attention to this issue.]
	-- fixed a build issue where some classes required for code generation were not necessarily
	   compiled prior to the code generation step, causing builds to fail. [Thanks to James
	   Neville for calling attention to this issue.]
c3p0-0.9.0
	-- under some circumstances, the current list of ThreadPoolAsynchronousRunner's deadlock detector
	   seems to hold onto a lot of memory... presumably this is when long pending task lists build up 
	   for some reason... nevertheless, we now dereference the "current" list in between deadlocker detector
	   invocations. The "last" list has to be retained between invocations, but the "current" list need
	   not be. [Thanks to Venkatesh Seetharamaiah for calling attention to this
	   issue, and for documenting the apparent source of object retention.]
	-- modified log4j and jdk14logging MLog implementations to test for library classes upon
	   classload (MLog class only tests for the presence of the mlog implementations, which
	   doesn't notice if their dependant classes aren't there -- dependent classes must test
	   for the presence of the libraries.)
	-- Modified GooGooStatementCache to warn as INFO (and with a descriptive message in debug)
	   of multple PreparedStatement preparation. [Thanks to mxnmatch on hibernate's forum for 
	   calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Modified BasicResourcePool to not warn on expected InterruptExceptions that occur if
	   clients are waiting for a Connection when the pool is closed. [Thanks to Blunted on
	   hibernate's forum for calling attention to this issue.]
c3p0-0.9.0-pre6
	-- Modified thread pool's strategy for dealing with deadlocks to prevent OutOfMemoryErrors
	   from sudden spawning of multiple threads to clear backlogged tasks. [Thanks to Greg Whalin
	   for calling attention to this problem.]
	-- Fixed bugs in debug reporting of nested Exceptions/Warnings when converting or
	   rethrowing SQLExceptions [thanks to an anonymous sourceforge poster for finding this]
	-- modified BasicResourcePool to shorten the period during which the pool's lock
	   is held during resource acquisition 
	-- maxIdleTime is generally enforced every (maxIdleTime / 8) seconds. Added logic to ensure that 
	   even for very long maxIdleTimes, the longest maxIdleTime will ever go unenforced is 15 minutes.
	-- Very tentative initial support in build for JUnit tests
	-- Fixed documentation typos and added sample config for Tomcat 5.5. [Thanks to David Newcomb 
	   for finding the typos and to Carl F. Hall for the sample config!]
	-- ProxyConnections were not properly resetting readOnly, holdability, catalog, and typeMap
	   properties on Connection close. Fixed. [Thanks to Andy (bjorkmann?) for calling attention
	   to this bug.]
	-- Added a complicated workaround to issues that may occur when a Connection
	   and its child statements simultaneously try to close. GooGooStatementCache's closeAll(Connection c)
	   method now wait()s for all Statements to close prior to returning, avoiding such issues (Oracle deadlock,
	   mysql NullPointerException), though dramatically complicating the code. Grrr. Theoretically, drivers should
	   be robust to the simultaneous closing of Statements and Connections, but they're not, so
	   my code gets to be more complicated. [Thanks to Juan Perez, Daniel Edberg, and Damien Evans for calling 
	   attention to this issue.]
c3p0-0.9.0-pre5
	-- Proxy classes were overaggressively invalidating themselves in response to a signalled
	   Connection error. This problem was very similar to the problem fixed in 0.8.5-pre9, except
	   for rather than the PooledConnection too quickly closing its inner Connection, the proxies
	   too quickly detached themselves from the pooled Connection, considering themselves broken,
	   after a Connection error event. Users expect to be able to work with their Connections even
	   after c3p0 has in its conservatism decided they no are no longer worthy of a place in the
	   pool. [Thanks to "Geoff Fortytwo" for finding and helping to track down this issue.]
	-- Fixed issue that prevented user-defined ConnectionTesters from being used.
c3p0-0.9.0-pre4
	-- Fixed NullPointerException on double-close of proxy Statements. [Thanks to Stephen Waud
	   for finding this bug and tracking it down.]
	-- Modified C3P0PooledConnectionPool to generate a more informative Exception (one that
	   includes the stack trace of the initial problem) when a Connection test fails. [Thanks
	   to novotny from the hibernate forums for calling attention to this issue.]
`	-- PooledDataSources now set SQLState 08001 on SQLExceptions resulting from a determination
	   by the pool that the database is down or unavailable. [Thanks to ml2709 on the hibernate
	   forums for calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Modified ThreadPoolAsynchronousRunner to enforce its max task time even on one-off
	   "emergency threads" used to flush the pool of tasks after an apparent deadlock.
	   Hopefully this will help to eliminate the OutOfMemoryErrors that users occasionally
	   see if some Database operation starts to fail by blocking indefinitely, and is attempted
	   many many times. As long as these operations are susceptable to interrupt(), this should
	   resolve the problem. (If tasks block in a way that is immune to interrupt(), there is
	   little c3p0 can do to recover the Threads and prevent the number of blocked Threads
	   from growing until memory runs out.) [Thanks to Jean-Christophe Rousseau and Arup Vidyerthy 
	   for calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Wrapped System.getProperties() calls in try / catch blocks that  catch and log 
	   the SecurityExceptions, and ignore System properties if access to them is forbidden. 
	   c3p0.properties configuration should work fine in security-controlled apps, but you 
	   won't be able to configure c3p0 using "java -Dc3p0.xxxx=yyy ..." Since most users use 
	   c3p0.properties for configuration, I don't think this will be a major problem. In the 
	   future, I may be able to work around the restriction by having ask only for c3p0-specific 
	   System properties, rather than calling the unrestricted System.getProperties() method. 
	   [Thanks to zambak on SourceForge for calling attention to this issue.]
c3p0-0.9.0-pre3
	-- Modified generated proxy classes to properly report the type of the closed Object
	   if used after call to close().
	-- Fixed a really embarrassing oversight, wherein cached PreparedStatements
	   were being physically close()ed prior to their return to the cache! Tests
	   on psql failed to reveal this, because psql-7.4 Statement.close() does nothing
	   to invalidate the Statement! [Many thanks to tbayboy on hibernate's forum for
	   discovering this issue, and to fassev, also on hibernate's forum, for correctly
	   deducing the cause!]
	-- Fixed an embarrassing oversight where operations of proxy Statements
	   and ResultSets failed to mark transactions as potentially dirty, leading
	   to the possibility that Connections with unresolved transactional work could
	   be checked into the pool.
	-- Modified c3p0 Statements to no longer permit calls to getConnection()
	   after Statement close, and to null out the backreference to the
	   parent Connection. [Thanks to Edward Bridges for pointing out the issue.]
	-- NewPooledConnection threw a NullPointerException on close() of
	   a ResultSet whose creating Statement had already been closed.
	   Fixed. [Thanks to Edward Bridges for pointing out the problem.]
	-- Modified PoolConfig to trim() read-in c3p0.properties to avoid
	   NumberFormatExceptions if there is extra spacing in the file.
	   [Thanks to johnchan for calling attention to this issue.]
c3p0-0.9.0-pre2
	-- Documentation updates and improvements
	-- Integrated configurable wrapper logging library, so that
	   c3p0 can log to log4j or jdk14logging.
c3p0-0.9.0-pre1
	-- First pass at documentation of JBoss integration.
	-- Better one-per-JVM canonicalization (IdentityTokenized,
	   IdentityTokenResolvable, C3P0Registry)
	-- First implementation of MBean for JBoss compatability
	-- Fixed JNDI ref-based DataSources
c3p0-0.8.5.1
        -- Fixed a really embarrassing bug that made Statement pooling worse than
           useless where users have set maxStatements but not maxStatementsPerConnection.
           maxStatementsPerConnection -- that is, 0 -- was being used in place of maxStatements
           on Statement cache initialization. [Thanks to Gwendal Tanguy for not only,
           calling attention to this issue, but tracking down the precise location of
           the bug!]
c3p0-0.8.5
	-- Documentation updates and improvements
	-- Fixed an issue where failures on reset() of a pooled Connection caused
	   a Connection error to be signalled, without updating the status of the
	   PooledConnection to indicate that it is broken. Thanks to Henry Le for
	   calling attention to this issue.
c3p0-0.8.5-pre9
	-- Modified c3p0's behavior on detecting an apparently broken Connection.
	   Previously c3p0 would very aggressively close any Connections that, after
	   an Exception, failed to pass a Connection test. This sometimes surprised
	   and confused users, when Conections they expected to remain open were 
	   closed from underneath them. Under normal circumstances, a Connection
	   which has failed its Connection test is broken anyway, so closing it
	   does no harm. But under some circumstances, a Connection may fail its
	   Connection test, but still be partly functional from the application's
	   point of view. So, now c3p0 simply marks Connections that fail their
	   Connection test following an Exception as broken, and excludes them from
	   future re-entry into the pool, but leaves those Connections open for users 
	   to continue working with them prior to their explicit close() of the
	   Connection. [Thanks to Julian Legeny for calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Modified c3p0's logging behavior to be a little bit less annoying. Rather than
	   frequently printing duplicate stack traces to be sure root cause Exceptions are
	   logged as well as converted, rethrown Exceptions, c3p0 now checks the Java 
	   version, and uses the initCause() method to log the root cause in versions 1.4
	   and above. Also, some Exceptions that were expected and thrown without information
	   as to the cause now use the initCause() method to provide this in JDK 1.4 and
	   above. [Thanks to Ruslan Gainutdinov, Anthiny Pereira, Carsten ????, and 
	   Eric Hsieh for calling attention to these issues.]
	-- Fixed bug whereby proxy wrappers were sometimes placed around null return values
	   from native Objects, particularly Statement's getResultSets() method. [Thanks to 
	   Ruslan Gainutdinov for calling attention to this issue.]
        -- Fixed bug in NewProxyConnection whereby setTransactionIsolation was called even
	   if the Connections' isolation level had not been changed from its default. [Thanks
	   to Levent Aksu for reporting this bug.]
c3p0-0.8.5-pre8
	-- Added C3P0ProxyStatement and rawStatementOperations for accessing vendor-specific
	   Statement API.
	-- Fixed bug whereby recently added properties could not be configured properly
	   via a PoolConfig Object passed to the DataSources factory method. [Thanks to
	   Julian Legeny for finding this bug.]
	-- Undid new behavior whereby c3p0 warns when it detects that a transaction
	   has not been comitted or rolled-back prior to close and must be automatically
	   rolled-back. Because c3p0 autorollsback conservatively, whenever it is possible
	   that there may be any transactional resources held by the Connection being
	   checked in, users who make read-only queries, then close without commit or
	   rollback, saw the warning, and became annoyed. Warning when it's "right" is hard,
	   and would involve paying attention to the substance of user-queries, as well
	   as the transaction's isolation level. In the future, when c3p0 offers better
	   control over logging, we'll make the warning optional. Note that this release
	   only undoes the warning -- the new logic that detects potential transactional work
	   and only rollsback when there has been some remains. [Thanks to David Graham for
	   calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Synchronized StatementCacheKey.find( ... ) method. Subclasses of StatementCacheKey
           have always explicitly relied upon this method being synchronized in the parent class, 
           but somehow it was not... [Thanks to Manfred Hutt for reporting this bug.]
	-- Modified both PooledConnection implementations to reset the transaction
	   isolation level on PooledConnection.reset()
	-- Finalized PooledDataSource api for pool stats and resets.
c3p0-0.8.5-pre7a
	-- Fixed some bugs in new Proxy classes relating to close(), methods,
	   especially NullPointerExceptions on duplicate close() operations.
	-- Fixed some misleading documentation re: testConnectionOnCheckin and
	   automaticTestTable vs. preferredTestQuery
	-- Changed wording of warning message on purge of idle-test-failing
	   resource to no longer suggest that some user action is required.
	   [Thanks to Krishna Kuchibhotla for calling attention to this
	   issue.]
	-- Modified GooGooStatementCache so that its close() is synchronous,
	   since when the Statement cache is closed, it's asynchronous
	   runner has often been closed already underneath it. (Actually
	   changed as of c3p0-0.8.5-pre7, but forgot to log it.)
c3p0-0.8.5-pre7
	-- Added flag (in both new and tradional reflective proxies) to
	   prevent automatic rollbacks on Connection close()es immediately post-
	   commit(), rollback(), or setAutoCommit().
	-- DatabaseMetaData now properly returns proxy rather than naked 
	   raw Connection. [Thanks to jhoeller on the hibernate forums]
	-- In response to an apparent BEA WebLogic specific problem with 
	   DriverManager.getConnection( ... ), DriverManagerDataSource now
	   caches its driver and uses Driver.connect( ... ) rather than 
	   DriverManager.getConnection() when acquiring Connections. Thanks to
	   Lars Torunski for calling attention to this issue.
	-- Fixed some missing synchroniztion that really should be provided for accessors
	   and mutators of DataSource bean properties.
	-- Added config parameter automaticTestTable, which takes the name of a table
	   that c3p0 will create and use as the basis for Connection tests. It's easier
	   to use than preferred test query, because you don't have to ensure the existance
	   of any tables in the schema prior to using a Pooled data source.
	-- Fixed idiotic oversight whereby Connections didn't get their transaction status
	   resolved and reset on check-in...
c3p0-0.8.5-pre6
	-- Modified resource pools to only conditionally support async ResourcePoolEvent
	   generation. Since c3p0 doesn't use ResourcePoolEvents, we can do without the
	   superfluous CarefulRunnableQueue, and its associated Thread, which was serving
	   as an event queue.
	-- Fixed bug where asynchronous refurbishment (testing) of resources would be
	   attempted even on check-in to a closed pool, whose async threads had terminated.
	-- c3p0 now supports the following new configuraion parameters: preferredTestQuery,
           testConnectionOnCheckin, checkoutTimeout, and maxStatementsPerConnection.
	   preferredTestQuery should allow c3p0 to test Connections (whether on checkout,
	   checkin, or after a specified idle time) much more efficiently than with
	   it's default test [a call to getTables(...) on the Connection's DatabaseMetaData.].
	   checkoutTimeout allows clients to break out of a getConnection() call after a 
	   a specified time period, rather than waiting (potentially indefinitely) for
	   a new Connection to be acquired from the database, or a checked-out Connection
	   to be rechecked in. testConnectionOnCheckin should be self-explanatory.
           maxStatementsPerConnections allows users to specify how many statements to cache
	   on a per-connection base instead of, or in addition to, the global limit maxStatements.
	-- Fixed various bugs relating to the referenceMaker and getReference() method of
	   ComboPooledDataSource.
	-- Added TestUtils class to util package (modified from an old C3P0TestUtils
	   class now removed from the test directory), which now contains facilities
	   for establishing the identity of the physical Connection beneath a proxy,
	   so that tests can check to see when they are seeing the same physical
	   Connections recycled. [Thanks to Julian Legeny for calling attention to this
	   issue.]
	-- Modified code generators so that inner objects of all NewProxy classes
	   go to null on object close(). Closed proxies should be hopelessly broken.
	-- Added missing parameter "usesTraditionalReflectiveProxies" 
	   to ComboPooledDataSource
	-- Fixed bug whereby CarefulRunnableQueue threads linger indefinitely, even
	   though their close() method has been called. [Thanks to muirwa on the
	   hibernate forums for calling attention to this issue.]
c3p0-0.8.5-pre5
	-- added utility class for Oracle users who wish to access vendor specific
	   Connection API relating to BLOBs and CLOBs. [Thanks to Dave Smith for calling
	   attention to this issue.]
	-- modified ThreadPoolAsynchronousRunner to provide more information should an 
	   "apparent deadlock" occur, and fixed that class' recovery strategy from such
	   an event. [Thanks to Damien Evans for calling attention to this issue.]
c3p0-0.8.5-pre4
	-- added config parameter usesTraditionalReflectiveProxies, which defaults to false,
	   and stitched in the 'new' codegenerated, non-reflective proxy implementation for
	   the default case.
c3p0-0.8.5-pre3
	-- Added new config parameters breakAfterAcquireFailure, acquireRetryAttempts, and 
	   acquireRetryDelay to ComboPoolBackedDataSource (forget to modify this class when 
	   I added the params earlier.)
	-- Added description of raw connection operations to docs.
c3p0-0.8.5-pre2
	-- Defined AuthMaskedProperties object, and used this to prevent usernames
	   and passwords from being dumped to logs (a security issue). [Thanks to Zac Jacobson
	   for calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Made BasicResourcePool's refurbishment of checked-in resources
	   asynchronous, and used this to add a test of the resource on check-in.
	   But since the extra test may slow stuff down substantially, I've disabled it
	   pending a testConnectionsOnCheckin config parameter.
	-- Fixed NullPointerException in C3P0ImplUtils.findAuth(Object o) which
	   occurred when the Object at issue had write-only properties. [Thanks to 
	   mrfekson for calling attention to this issue.]
	-- Added acquireRetryAttempts, acquireRetryDelay, and breakAfterAcquireFailure
	   as configurable properties. Supporting breakAfterAcquireFailure == false
	   required substantial changes to BasicResourcePool. [Thanks to Zac Jacobson
	   for suggesting the behavior for breakAfterAcquireFailure == false.]
	-- Added poolOwnerIdentityToken property to PoolBackedDataSource, 
	   which becomes part of the state of C3P0PooledConectionPoolManager,
	   to avoid possibility that multiple, identically configured pools 
	   that users create separately and consider distinct would be closed
	   if any one of them were closed. This parameter ensures that for
	   each user-created DataSource, there will be a distinct 
	   C3P0PooledConectionPoolManager. Multiple copies, as often arise
	   via deserialization and/or dereferencing JNDI DataSources, will
	   still share a single pool and configuration.
	-- Added reset methods, hard and soft, to PooledDataSource and 
	   its implementations. Also added some extra aggregate pool statistics
	   methods. [Thanks to Travis Reeder for suggesting the hardReset() behavior.]
	-- Fixed bug that PoolBackedDataSource always provided statistics for the
	   default authentication pool, even when alternate usernames and passwords
	   were provided.
c3p0-0.8.5-pre1
        -- Defined the C3P0ProxyConnection interface, and modified both reflective and unreflective
	   proxy Connection code to implement it. The interface provides a method through which 
	   advanced users can work with the raw, unproxied database Connection. This was motivated
	   by some Oracle-specific API that could not be passed through the generic Connections
	   returned by c3p0 pools. Thanks to Dave Smith for calling attention to this issue.
	-- Fixed a NullPointerException that resulted when users called DriverManagerDataSource's
	   getConnection( username, password ) with either username or password as null. Users
	   will now see the SQLException provided by their database for bad authentication, which 
	   should make the problem more obvious.
c3p0-0.8.4.5
	-- Modified all variants of StatementCacheKey, as well as C3P0PooledConnection (proxy Statements)
	   to support jdbc3.0 API for autogenerated keys and ResultSet holdability. All jdbc 3.0 API
	   is now supported.
c3p0-0.8.4.2
	-- Fixed bug in which proxy Statements and ResultSets returned their 
	   naked, unproxied parents from their getConnection() / getStatement()
	   methods. Thanks to Christian Josefsson for noticing this!
	-- Added check to ensure that ResourcePools are not broken prior to
	   posting asynchronous events. It'd be better to factor the (as yet
	   unutilized async event stuff into a subclass to simplify 
	   BasicResourcePool).
	-- Fixed documentation typo that said default numHelperThreads was "false"... 
	   now it's correctly set to "3".
	-- Added extra System.err information to instrument the causes of broken
	   resource pools.
	-- finalize() method of BasicResourcePool checks to be sure user has not
	   already closed the pool before closing, to avoid spurious multiple
	   close warnings. Thanks to Gavin King.
c3p0-0.8.4.1
	-- Added (hopefully not too annoying) dump of DataSource configuration
	   on pool initialization to assist user debugging.
	-- Added methods to force destroy all resources used by a PooledDataSource,
	   even if other DataSource instances are sharing those resources. This is
	   intended primarily for applications that wish to discard the ClassLoader that
	   loaded c3p0, regardless of whatever's currently going on.
	-- Turned off annoying trace messages when a C3P0PooledConnection closes.
	-- Fixed issue in statement cache whereby statements that fail to check-in
	   properly (that throw an exception in "clearParameters") cause an exception
	   in removeStatement, because removeStatement sees a statement that appears
	   neither to be checked-out, nor in the deathmarch for checked-in statements.
	   Resolved by re-adding truculent statement to the checkedOut set, and then
	   destroying using removeStatement's codepath for removing and (force-)destroying
	   checked-out statements. Thanks to Zach Scott for calling attention to
	   this issue.
c3p0-0.8.4
	-- Updated and HTML-ized documentation, updated READMEs. 
c3p0-0.8.4-test5
	-- Includes, but does not yet use, cleaner, nonreflective
	   reimplementation of C3P0PooledConnection and all of the
	   JDBC proxy wrappers. (c3p0-0.8.4 will stick with the old,
	   tested implementation, c3p0-0.8.5 will replace.)
	-- Removed temporary debug wrapper around acquired Connections
	   added in c3p0-0.8.4-test4-3.
c3p0-0.8.4-test4-3
	-- Fixed race condition in BasicResourcePool close(), whereby
	   pooled resources were to be destroyed by an asynchronous thread
	   that itself was shut down by the close() method, so the resource
	   closures did not necessarily occur. Pooled resources are now
	   destroyed synchronously in BasicResourcePool.close()
	-- Fixed erroneous call to C3P0PooledConnection reset() even when
	   the PooledConnection is known to be broken.
	-- Added temporary debug wrapper that dumps a stack trace on physical
	   Connection close() to help Adrian track down a stubborn issue.
c3p0-0.8.4-test4
	-- Made sure PooledConnection's that are known to be broken are not reset()
	   when the ProxyConnection that noticed the break cleans itself up.
	-- Fixed a problem in C3P0PooledConnection's ProxyConnectionInvocationHandler
	   when Connection-invalidating exceptions occurred inside the factored-out
	   doSilentClose() method rather than in the invoke() method. This could lead to
	   broken PooledConnections not being noticed and expunged from the pool 
	   prior to recheck-out.
	-- Ensured stack-trace of any Connection-invalidating Exceptions are
	   logged. (Previously only the messages were logged.)
	-- Access to ProxyConnections is now synchronized to avoid a possible
	   race condition where a Connection could close while another method
	   was in progress.
	-- Cleaned up C3P0PooledConnection a bit, got rid of no longer used
	   reflective code, modified to use new SQL interface filter classes.
	-- Reorganized bean generation stuff to sit under com.mchange.v2.codegen
	-- Added com.mchange.v2.sql.filter package, and code generation stuff so
	   that abstract filter classes that implement JDBC interfaces can be
	   easily regenerated from current versions. (This is preparation for
	   JDK 1.4.x build support.)
c3p0-0.8.4-test3
	-- Reorganized C3P0PooledConnection and C3P0PooledConnectionPool so that
	   PooledConnections only fire connectionErrorOccurred events on errors that
	   signal the Connection is invalid. (Previously we fired the event in all
	   cases, then tested the validity of the connection in the event handler.)
	-- Fixed a bug where SQLExceptions that do not signal invalid Connections
	   (such as an exception on transaction commit under optimistic concurrency)
	   caused Connections to be closed, but still returned to the pool, leaving
	   the pool corrupt. [Thanks to Adrian Petru Dimulescu for discovering and
	   reporting this subtle problem!]
c3p0-0.8.4-test2
	-- Backed off a binary incompatible change to DataSources API. Users
	   interested in statistics about running DataSources will need to
	   cast the result of DataSources.pooledDataSource() to a
	   com.mchange.v2.c3p0.PooledDataSource object. Other users should
	   be able to use DataSources without recompilinbg libraries that
	   depend upon it.
	-- Defined com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource, a single, directly-instantiable
	   JavaBean-style DataSource backed by a c3p0 pool, which makes integration
	   with various app servers easier (e.g. works with Tomcat), and which may
	   provide a more straightforward API for users than DataSources and PoolConfig.
c3p0-0.8.4-test1
        -- Switched various classes from using RoundRobinAsynchronousRunner 
           to a new ThreadPoolAsynchronousRunner.         
        -- Defined PoolingDataSource interface, which permits clients to access
           statistics about the state of underlying pools, and made C3P0 pool-backed
           DataSources implement that interface.
        -- fixed a subtle bug with respect to ownership of shared resources in which
           finalize() methods for discarded DataSources could cause helper threads and
           other resources to be cleaned up prematurely, while they are still in use
           by other DataSources.
        -- major reorganization of code generation for DataSources and the
           resulting objects.
        -- reorganization of Serializable and Referenceable code of DataSources
           for JNDI Binding
        -- made PoolConfig defaults (which are set by system properties, a 
           c3p0.properties file, or else hardcoded defaults) apply to DataSources
           that are directly instantiated rather than created via the 
           com.mchange.v2.c3p0.DataSources factory class.
	-- organized scattered stuff into a self-contained, distributable build
	   directly, and divided source and binary distributions
        -- relicensed library; now available under LGPL.
	-- THERE ARE SOME MAJOR REORGANIZATIONS IN THIS RELEASE. ANY HELP IN
	   TESTING AND FEEDBACK WOULD BE APPRECIATED! THANKS!
c3p0-0.8.3.1
        -- take greater care to abort if a helper thread wakes from wait()
           inside of a broken resource pool
        -- log more debug information if a pool unexpectedly breaks
c3p0-0.8.3
	-- resolved a deadlock arising from ConnectionEventSupport objects
           calling event listener methods while holding the ConnectionEventSupport's
           lock. (Thanks to an anonymous Sourceforge bug submitter for tracking this
           down.)
        -- added two configuration parameters to modify how c3p0 deals with
           potentially unresolved transactions on transaction close -- 
           autoCommitOnClose and forceIgnoreUnresolvedTransactions. c3p0's
           default behavior is as it always was (and as I think it nearly
           always should be) -- by default we roll back any uncommitted work
           on close. See PoolConfig class for complete documentation.
        -- fixed stupid build error that made unzipping c3p0 archives messy
           since c3p0-0.8.2. (SORRY!)
c3p0-0.8.3-pre-travis
        -- fixed problem with c3p0 trying endlessly to connect to a database
           that is down or not present. c3p0 now tries thirty time, once per
           second, then gives up. if there's demand, I'll make the delay and
           number of attempts user configurable. Thanks to Alfonso da Silva
           for calling attention to this problem.
        -- modified RoundRobinAsynchronousRunner to die more gracefully if, 
           somehow, one of its CarefulAsynchronousRunners somehow dies. Thanks to
           Travis Reeder for calling attention to this issue.
        -- modified ResourcePools to allow resources to be tested periodically
           and asynchronously while they are idle in the pool.
        -- added to a new configuration property to PoolConfig and related
           classes, idleConnectionTestPeriod, which if set to a greater-than-zero
           value will cause c3p0 to periodically test idle, pooled connection,
           and remove them from the pool if they are broken.  Thanks to
           Travis Reeder for calling attention to this issue.
        -- removed SQLState 08S01 from the set of SQL states presumed to mean
           all connections in the pool have become invalid. Apparently MySQL
           uses this SQLState to indicate the timing out of idle, individual
           connections.  Thanks to Travis Reeder for calling attention to this issue.
        -- many (!) bug-fixes, small tweaks and improvements.
        -- temporarily sprinkled some debugging output prefixed "c3p0-TRAVIS" to 
           try to resolve some issues for Travis Reeder
c3p0-0.8.2
        -- Addressed a rare problem that ocurred when application servers or
           other external code calls interrupt() on c3p0 helper threads. Thanks 
	   to Travis Reeder for reporting this issue! The endless cascade of 
	   ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException that would occasionallY result has 
	   been fixed, and c3p0 helper threads now ignore interupts,
           which should almost completely prevent such interrupts() 
           from leaving c3p0 pools in a corrupt state. [In the very, very
	   unlikely event that multiple, well-timed interrupts() cause
	   a pool to diagnose itself broken, c3p0 will start throwing clear 
	   exceptions to indicate that -- there shouldn't be any deadlock or
	   any subtle kind of corruption.]
	-- Deprecated PoolBackedDataSourceFactory and DriverManagerDataSourceFactory
	   in favor of the newer DataSources class.
        -- Updated example code and documentation.
	-- Moved constants from DataSources to PoolConfig where they belong!
c3p0-0.8.2-pre10
        -- Removed use of properties default mechanism in setting up JDBC
           properties for DriverManagerDataSource, as some drivers use get()
           rather than getProperties(), and the Properties.get() method ignores
           defaults. [Thanks go to Michael Jakl <mj@int-x.org> for both finding
           and fixing this problem!!!]
        -- Fixed subtle problem whereby the introspective constructor of 
           C3P0PooledConnectionPoolManager would inadvertently check out an
           extra pooled connection, by treating the getPooledConnection() as
           a simple property read and invoking it. [Thanks go to Michael Jakl 
           <mj@int-x.org> for both finding and fixing this bug!!!]
c3p0-0.8.2-pre9
        -- Finished DataSources static factory for, um, DataSources.
        -- Added PoolConfig class to encapsulate all configuration
           information from factories
	-- Set up PoolConfig to pay attention to (in order):
             1) explicit, user-defined parameters
             2) parameters defined as System properties
             3) parameters defined in a Properties file resource, at
                resource pasth /c3p0.properties in PoolConfig's classloader
	     4) Hardcoded defaults from the C3P0Defaults class
        -- Defined a new pool configuration property, "testConnectionOnCheckout".
           If set to true (it defaults to false), each pooled Connection will be 
           verified at checkout time, before being supplied to clients. THIS SLOWS
           CONNECTION CHECKOUT DRAMATICALLY (by an order of magnitude on my machine),
           but some folks may want it. The expensive, verified Connections are still
           faster to acquire than brand new ones.
        -- If a Connection experiences an SQLException with a defined SQL State of
           08001, 08007, or 08S01, the entire database is considered to have been
           shutdown, and the pool whose connection experienced the problem is reset 
           -- i.e. all existing Connections are discarded, and new Connections are 
           acquired for the pool. (Thanks! to Gavin King for suggesting the SQL State
           approach to detecting disconnects.)
        -- ConnectionTester interface and its default implementation were modified
           to support reporting DATABASE_IS_INVALID (rather than simply testing a
           disconnected, individual Connection).
c3p0-0.8.2-pre8
        -- Fixed some really stupid bugs from pre-7, in particular
           the static factory methods of the DataSources class were
           not declared static. Oops. 
c3p0-0.8.2-pre7
        -- Major reorganization of data source implementations. These
           are now generated from XML templates, because it was becoming
           difficult to keep multiple versions of multiple types of 
           datasources in sync with one another
        -- a new factory / utility class has been added, 
           com.mchange.v2.c3p0.DataSources.
           Soon the older factories (DriverManagerDataSourceFactory and 
           PoolBackedDataSourceFactory) will be deprecated in favor of this.
        -- Began adding support for wrapper DataSources that lazily bind to 
           an unpooled DataSource specified via JNDI. (Current wrappers require
           an actual instance, not a mere reference in order to construct a
           PoolBacked or ConnectionPoolDataSource).
c3p0-0.8.2-pre6
	-- Fixed bug that led to ConcurrentModificationException
	   when Connection.close() iterates through and closes
	   its unclosed Statements.
	-- Fixed bug that caused uncached Statements to sometimes
	   be closed twice, as they were not properly removed from
	   the set of Connection-associated statements on user-
           initiated Statement.close(), and would thus be closed 
           again on Connection.close().
	-- Reorganized classes to clean up top-level com.mchange.v2.c3p0
	   package. The gory innards of c3p0 now live in an impl package.
	-- Reorganized DataSources so that there are "Base" versions suitable
	   for DBMS-specific subclassing.
c3p0-0.8.2-pre5
        -- DataSources looked up by JNDI now "coalesce" -- i.e., if
           two separate calls look-up the same JNDI bound DataSource,
           they will both see the same DataSource instance in the local
           VM. This is especially important for PoolBackedDataSources, as they
           own "helper threads" that help to manage the pool. Now each
           logical DataSource shares the same pool of helper threads,
           regardless of whether it is looked up once and cached, or
	   looked up multiple times and at multiple places by an application. 
        -- Number of helper-threads managing a PoolBackedDataSource is now
           user-configurable
c3p0-0.8.2-pre4
        -- Fixed BAD memory leak -- cachedStatements were being retained
           on close. This brings a performance improvement to
	   the StatementCache as well.
	-- Set-up StatementCacheKey to coalesce, such that its equals
	   method can look like {return (this == o);}. Unfortunately, I
	   did not see the kind of performance increase I'd anticipated
	   from this... in fact, whatever performance changes I did see were
	   pretty negligable. Performed some other, mostly useless, optimizations
	   to the process of acquiring StatementCacheKeys. (I can't decide...
           I've got 3 usuable, broadly similar versions of StatementCacheKey now.)
	-- Fixed bugs having to do with when to create and the daemon status
	   of Timers
	-- Appropriately synchronized access to PoolBackedDataSource. (This
	   should permit me to pull back on synchronization / marking of
	   volatile in some dependent classes, as access to these is now 
           controlled via PoolBackedDataSource.)
	-- Made instantion of C3P0PooledConnectionPoolManager 
           by WrapperPoolBackedDataSource "lazy", so that Timer / Async task
	   threads are only started up when a Connection is actually requested 
	   from a DataSource. This is useful especially for the instance residing
	   in the JNDI server VM, whose purpose is likely only to serve as an
	   instance to be looked up over the network. There's no reason why
	   it should keep several stalled Threads open.
	-- Fixed DefaultConnectionTester, whose logic was bass-ackwards.
c3p0-0.8.2-pre3
	-- Factory method for StatementCacheKeys now "coalesce" equivalent 
	   instances to conserve memory and to enable a fast (this == o) test 
	   to usually work in equals methods. [Value test remains for when 
	   identity test fails... maybe later I'll be more comfortable with a 
	   1 instance per value guarantee, and remove the rest of the test. 
	   As the constructor is private, the factory method coalesces, and the 
	   class is not Serializable, an identity test should suffice. But 
	   I'm paranoid.]

	-- All asynchronous tasks are now distributed to 3 helper threads per 
	   DataSource rather than queuing on just one. (Culing of expired 
	   Connections is still managed by a single java.util.Timer... I don't 
	   think this will be a problem.)

c3p0-0.8.2-pre2
	-- Total rewite of Statement cache!
